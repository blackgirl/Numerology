        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> This name, the complete birth name, symbolizes the opportunities you have at your disposal. This is sometimes referred to as your potential or destiny. Living up to attributes of this number may not be easy, but it is your goal in the here and now.  It is your life's purpose, spiritual mission, and your field of opportunity.  Unlike the Life Path number which reads as you are, the Destiny number more correctly reads as you MUST or what you can aspire to become.
