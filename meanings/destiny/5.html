<p>The number 5 Destiny suggests that the direction of growth in your lifetime will be toward becoming a harbinger of change, freedom, and progressive thought and action. The number 5 Destiny potentially endows you with the wonderful characteristic of multi-talents and versatility. You must develop in ways allowing you to do so many things well. The tone of the number 5 is the constructive use of freedom, and in your drive to attain this freedom, you must be the master of adaptability and change.</p>
<p>As you mature, you must become good at presenting ideas and knowing how to approach people to get what you want. Naturally, this will give you an edge in any sort of selling game and spells easy success when it comes to working with people in most jobs. Whatever you do, you have the capacity to be clever, analytical, and a very quick thinker.</p>
<p>You must learn to accept changes as they come along and avoid clinging to the outdated. Avoid rebellion, and focus on enlightenment and progression thinking that will benefit mankind. Your life is broadened by gaining an understanding and an appreciation of all kinds of people.</p>
<p>The Destiny 5 will be welcome in many varied professional environments. The public sector is a natural for you because you must administer to all peoples. The media, advertising, promotion, publicity, all types of selling, and entertainment are all potential fields that may interest you. Settling on a single career may not be in the cards for you, as you are in a continuous state of flux brought by constantly changing interests.</p>
<p>If there is too much of the 5 energy in your makeup or if you develop negatively, the negative side of the number may appear. Your restless and impatient attitude may keep you from staying with any project for too long. Sometimes you can be erratic and scatter yourself and your energies. You have a hard time keeping regular office hours and maintaining any sort of a routine. As clever as you are, you may have a tendency to make the same mistakes over and over again. Much of your response to such errors is glib reaction rather that thoughtful application.</p>
